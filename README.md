# Factors
 Factors is an open source project for various arithmetic operations

## Usage
The tool is hosted using GitHub Pages https://nite2048.github.io/factors/.

However, the [library file](project/factors.js) contains the source code for the operations which can be used independently.

```js
// check if the number is prime
is_prime(number)

// find the factors and the prime factors of a number
find_factors(number)
find_prime_factors(number)

// find the highest and the lowest common factor of a number
find_highest_common_factor([number,number])
find_lowest_common_factor([number,number])
```
